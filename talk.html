    <h2> History </h2> <!-- first section of my TOC about the history of Chinese Cuisine -->
    <p> Chinese cuisine all started with a 4 thousand year old archaelogical find of the oldest noodle found in the upper parts of the Chinese Yellow River. The development of grain during the Han dynasty allowed for cooking to develop too. Specialization of Chinese cuisine then developed during the Tang Dynasty, when tea also rose in popularity as if signified wealth and balance. It was during the Song Dynasty when trade flourished, making cooking more accessible to people, allow Chinese cuisine to blossom. </p>

    <h2> My fav Chinese Restaurant </h2> <!-- third section of my TOC about my favorite Chinese cuisine restaurant -->
    <p> My favorite Chinese Restaurant is 99 Flavors. It is an All-You-Can-Eat hot pot buffet. There are several locations across the city, including in Queens, Brooklyn, and Chinatown. Since the buffet style at 99 Flavors allows me to customize my meals, I often lead towards the beef, udon noodles, rectangular fishcake, and enokitake for the hotpot section. I like eating the BBQ pork and corn for the BBQ section. </p>
